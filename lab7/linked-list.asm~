# (removed dependance on in-line constant definitions)
#  This program builds a heap as a singly-linked list of nodes that
#  are then used to build a singly-linked list of numbers.
#       mknodes: builds a linked list of free nodes from an 
#                 unstructured heap space. 
#       new:    (you complete it) returns a node from the free list
#       insert: (you write) inserts an integer into a linked list, in order.
#       print:  (you write) traverses a list and prints its contents neatly

# mknodes takes a heap address in a0, its byte-size in a1, and node size in a2
#  and partitions it into a singly-linked list of nodesize
# (NODESIZE-byte) nodes, pointed to by free.  
# NOTE:  the list is built with free pointing to the last node in the
#    heap area, which points to the previous one, etc.  The reason for
#    this construction is to be sure that you get nodes by calling
#    "new" rather than by rebuilding the heap yourself!

# inputs:
# $a0 contains a pointer to the heap
# $a1 contains the heapsize
